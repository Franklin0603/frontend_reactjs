## Param Changes

### Change the project to Vite from Create-React-App

- Vite has become preferred recently to scaffold React projects, CRA started having lots of bugs.
- Start Project - `npm run dev`
- Build Project - `npm run build`

### Tailwind CSS

- Much easier to use because it allows you write CSS inline with in our JS files.
- If this is not your style, check out Styled Components.

### Material UI

- React component library, makes life a lot easier to build great looking components without all the time investment.
  - I'm not the biggest front-end fan so I love this.
- for example, the [Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/getting-started/#installation) is much easier and faster to use than the table you've created from scratch.
